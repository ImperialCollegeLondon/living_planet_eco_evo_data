This practical uses \n\nthe R programming\nlanguage to load, manipulate and analyse spatial data.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for using R:\n\nIt is an open-source, cross-platform and free program.\n\nIt provides a powerful set of GIS data tools and packages extend this GIS\nfunctionality into a well estabished ecosystem of R packages for ecological and\nevolutionary analysis, including species distribution modelling, population genetics\nand many other areas.\n\nWriting spatial analyses as R scripts provides a clear reproducible research record.\n\nThere are disadvantages to using R as a GIS platform:\n\nPrincipally, although it can create very high quality spatial graphics, it is not a\nGIS data visualiser and explorer program. It is not as easy to zoom and pan around\nspatial datasets in R or to alter the way in which a set of layers overlay each other.\n\nIt can also be difficult to find the exact set of commands you need to get the result\nyou are after (although this can also be true of other systems)!\n\nIf you end up using GIS more widely in your research project, you may find it useful to\nlook at other GIS programs for exploring and visualising data:\n\nThe most well known is probably the ESRI ArcGIS package: Imperial College London does\nhave a \n\nlicensing agreement for\nArcGIS\nbut it is Windows only software and is expensive to use.\n\nThe \n\nQGIS program is an open source and cross platform\nalternative to ArcGIS and is very worth exploring.\n\nYou might also want to look at geocomputation in other programming languages. The\n\n\ngeocompx website provides an amazing resource for:\n\nreproducible geographic data analysis, modeling, and visualization with open source\nsoftware\n\nThe geocompx website provides guidance on using R, Python and Julia to do spatial\nanalysis and is a fantastic resource for learning more about using spatial data and\nprovides the \n\ncore R textbook for this practical.\n\nAnother great resource is the \n\nrspatial website,\nwhich provides a lot of information on using terra and other spatial tools in R.","type":"content","url":"/gis-practical","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Spatial methods in Ecological and Evolutionary Data Science","lvl2":"Required packages"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/gis-practical#required-packages","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Spatial methods in Ecological and Evolutionary Data Science","lvl2":"Required packages"},"content":"We will need to load the following packages.

There are various methods\nto carry out resampling - see the method details in ?project but they basically fall\ninto two groups:\n\nMost are interpolations methods for getting a representative continuous value for\neach cell from the data in the original raster grid. They range from simple average\nvalues of intersecting cells, to more complex polynomials and splines (e.g cubic)\nthat use a moving window of a neighbourhood of cells to construct an estimate for the\nnew cell.\n\nOther approaches select a single value from the source grid: the near method takes\nthe value from the source raster cell closest to the centre of the new cell, and the\nmode value takes the modal value of the set of overlapping cells. Both of these\napproaches are intended for use with categorical raster data, where it makes no sense\nto interpolate values between category codes.\n\nTo use the terra::project function, you need to provide a raster with the target\nresolution and projection to use as a template.
