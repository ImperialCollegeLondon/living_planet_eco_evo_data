There are various methods\nto carry out resampling - see the method details in ?project but they basically fall\ninto two groups:\n\nMost are interpolations methods for getting a representative continuous value for\neach cell from the data in the original raster grid. They range from simple average\nvalues of intersecting cells, to more complex polynomials and splines (e.g cubic)\nthat use a moving window of a neighbourhood of cells to construct an estimate for the\nnew cell.\n\nOther approaches select a single value from the source grid: the near method takes\nthe value from the source raster cell closest to the centre of the new cell, and the\nmode value takes the modal value of the set of overlapping cells. Both of these\napproaches are intended for use with categorical raster data, where it makes no sense\nto interpolate values between category codes.\n\nTo use the terra::project function, you need to provide a raster with the target\nresolution and projection to use as a template.
